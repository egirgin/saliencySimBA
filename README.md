# saliencySimBA
Saliency Map Guided Scoring-Based Adversarial Black Box Attack
 * run ```training.ipynb``` to create model weights

 * run ```attack.ipynb``` to apply SimBA attack. 

 * Change ```mode``` variable. 
    * 1 -> Uniform sampling
    * 2 -> Gaussian sampling
    * 3 -> Saliency based sampling

 * Run ```report.ipynb``` to see the statistics. Change experiment name based on ```mode``` variable.
